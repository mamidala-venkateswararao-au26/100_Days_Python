What do you understand by type conversion ?
ans) Type conversition is nothing but to change the one data type to onther datatype.

Write a program to find out the simple interest .


2)Differentiate between explicit and implicit conversion?
Ans)  Implicit conversion is nothing but the data type takes conversion during the runtime automatacally..
  example:
  a-10
  b=1.7
  print(type(a))    ## output -int
  print(type(b))    ##output -float

---> In Explicit type conversion, we manually alter the datatype of a Python object to suit our purpose.
 a=2
b=2.3
c=float(a)
d=int(b)

print(c)    # output-2.0
print(d)    # output -2
  
3)What do you understand by string?
 Ans) Strings are used for representing the textual data.A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes ('') or double quotes (“”) .


4)What do you understand by immutabilty and mutabilty of data type?
  Mutable is nothing but anything can be modified or changeble..   ex: list,dist,sets

  immutable is nothing but which is cannot to be changed .  ex: tuples,Strings


5)Explain the concept of indexing?

Explain scenario when final answer is false if we are using “and” operator

What do you understand by precedence of operators
